  "initiativeCore": {
    "problemStatement": "Build a browser-based interactive xylophone app that runs locally by simply opening an HTML file with no backend required. The interface should display an 11-note xylophone with visually distinct bars, and beneath it show a short instruction inviting users to click or tap the bars or press the keyboard row starting with A, S, D, F, G and continuing across the row to explore the sounds. Each bar must trigger a musical note generated directly in the browser using the Web Audio API with an oscillator and gain envelope (no external audio files), producing instant playback, low latency, overlapping notes, and a short percussive decay to resemble a xylophone tone. Provide brief visual feedback when a bar is activated, keep the implementation strictly in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with clear modular code and minimal dependencies, and optionally support responsive layout, simple theme customization, volume control, or basic sequence recording.",
    "goals": [
      "Deliver a standalone, zero-dependency browser-based xylophone application",
      "Enable instant musical interaction through mouse/touch and keyboard input",
      "Generate realistic xylophone tones using Web Audio API without external audio files",
      "Provide intuitive visual interface with clear user instructions"
    ],
    "nonGoals": [
      "Backend server implementation or cloud hosting",

      "Advanced music composition features beyond basic sequence recording",
      "Multi-user collaboration or sharing capabilities",
      "Integration with external music libraries or DAWs"
    ],
    "businessImpact": "Success delivers an educational/entertainment tool demonstrating Web Audio API capabilities with zero infrastructure cost and instant deployment. Failure results in poor user experience through audio latency, browser compatibility issues, or unintuitive interaction patterns, limiting adoption and educational value.",
    "stakeholders": "End users (music learners, casual users exploring web audio), developers evaluating Web Audio API patterns, educational institutions seeking browser-based music tools"
