  "architecture": "Single-page browser application using Web Audio API for real-time sound synthesis. Modular JavaScript architecture with separation of concerns: audio engine handles Web Audio API interactions, xylophone module manages note mapping and triggering, input handler processes user interactions, visual feedback manages UI animations, controls handle optional features, and app.js orchestrates initialization. No external dependencies, no build process, runs entirely in browser with offline capability after initial load. Audio generated using oscillators with ADSR envelope for percussive xylophone timbre. Event-driven architecture supports overlapping notes and low-latency playback."
